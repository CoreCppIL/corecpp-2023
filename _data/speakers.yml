    <p>Dr. Daisy S. Hollman began working with the C++ standards committee in 2016, where she has made contributions to a wide range of library and language features, including proposals related to executors, atomics, generic programming, futures, and multidimensional arrays. Since receiving her Ph.D. in Quantum Chemistry in 2013, her research has focussed primarily on parallel and concurrent programming models, though a broader focus on general accessibility of complex abstractions has become her focus in more recent years. She currently works on C++ language and library design at Google, where she continues to focus on providing broad accessibility of programming models and abstractions, with a particular focus on design for diversity and inclusivity.</p>

    <p>I've worked as a software architect, team lead, and instructor since 1999. In 2002, I created
    company-intern meetings for further education and have given training courses since 2002. My first
    tutorials were about proprietary management software, but I began teaching Python and C++ soon after.
    In my spare time, I like to write articles about C++, Python, and Haskell, and to speak at conferences.
    I publish weekly on my English blog <a href="https://www.modernescpp.com/">Modernes Cpp</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.grimm-jaud.de/index.php/blog">German blog</a>, hosted by Heise Developer.
    Since 2016, I'm an independent instructor giving seminars about modern C++ and Python. In the last ten years,
    I published several books in various languages about modern C++. Due to my profession, I always search
    for the best way to teach modern C++.</p>
