  name: "Rainer"
  surname: "Grimm"
  bio: >
    <p>I've worked as a software architect, team lead, and instructor since 1999. In 2002, I created
    company-intern meetings for further education and have given training courses since 2002. My first
    tutorials were about proprietary management software, but I began teaching Python and C++ soon after.
    In my spare time, I like to write articles about C++, Python, and Haskell, and to speak at conferences.
    I publish weekly on my English blog <a href="https://www.modernescpp.com/">Modernes Cpp</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.grimm-jaud.de/index.php/blog">German blog</a>, hosted by Heise Developer.
    Since 2016, I'm an independent instructor giving seminars about modern C++ and Python. In the last ten years,
    I published several books in various languages about modern C++. Due to my profession, I always search
    for the best way to teach modern C++.</p>
