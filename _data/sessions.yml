#    <p><b>WORKSHOP</b></p>
#    <p>This course provides an overview of the low-level Linux features–set-UID programs, capabilities, namespaces, and control groups (v2)–that are used
#    to implement privileged applications and build container, virtualization, and sandboxing technologies. (The course does not cover systems such as
#    Docker and LXC, but participants will gain an an insight into the implementation and operation of such systems.)</p>
#    <p>The primary audience comprises designers and programmers building privileged applications, container applications, and sandboxing applications.
#    Systems administrators who manage such applications will also find the course of benefit. Participants should have some awareness of classical
#    Linux/UNIX concepts such as file descriptors and file I/O, signals, and the process lifecycle (fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()). In addition,
#    participants should have a reading knowledge of the C programming language. (Note, however, that the course exercises do not require writing any programs.)</p>
