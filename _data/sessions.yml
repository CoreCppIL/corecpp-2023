#  title: "Linux Security and Isolation APIs essentials"
#  description: >
#    <p><b>WORKSHOP</b></p>
#    <p>This course provides an overview of the low-level Linux features–set-UID programs, capabilities, namespaces, and control groups (v2)–that are used
#    to implement privileged applications and build container, virtualization, and sandboxing technologies. (The course does not cover systems such as
#    Docker and LXC, but participants will gain an an insight into the implementation and operation of such systems.)</p>
#    <p>The primary audience comprises designers and programmers building privileged applications, container applications, and sandboxing applications.
#    Systems administrators who manage such applications will also find the course of benefit. Participants should have some awareness of classical
#    Linux/UNIX concepts such as file descriptors and file I/O, signals, and the process lifecycle (fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()). In addition,
#    participants should have a reading knowledge of the C programming language. (Note, however, that the course exercises do not require writing any programs.)</p>

  title: "Designing and Implementing Safe C++ Applications"
  description: >
    <p>This workshop aims to address the design and implementation principles and tactics necessary for creating secure C++
    applications. While memory issues will be given proper attention, it's important to note that application safety extends
    beyond this. To ensure application safety, it is crucial to capture requirements correctly, make appropriate design choices,
    implement code securely, and conduct testing, static code analysis, and dynamic sanitizing. Through relevant
    examples and class practice, we will cover the entire life cycle of creating secure applications, and provide a
    checklist for achieving enhanced safety and improved code quality.</p>

  title: "Concurrency in Modern C++"
  description: >
    <p>This class gives you a detailed insight into the multithreading facilities of C++. Starting with the foundation
    in C++11, continuing with the parallel STL in C++17, and closing with the concurrency features in C++20.</p>

  title: "Exploring Rust to Enhance Your C++ Skills"
  description: >
    <p>This class is designed to help C++ developers explore Rust, an increasingly popular and powerful language. Through
    hands-on examples and projects, students will learn why Rust has become so widely adopted and why it is such an attractive
    choice for C++ developers. Learning Rust will not only enable attendees to take a peek at this new language, but
    will also greatly enhance the quality of their C++ code.</p>
    <p>In the first part of the class, students will learn about Rust's history, governance model, and community. We will
    also discuss the main technical selling points of Rust and its current level of maturity. Following this, we will go through a
    "Hello World" example in Rust so that students can become familiar with Rust's syntax and understand some of the fundamental features.</p>
    <p>To further solidify their understanding of these concepts, students will then work on a "guess the number" game project.
    We will look at how to improve the game by using pattern matching and extracting functionality to separate functions.</p>
    <p>In addition to the fundamentals, the class will cover the use of external libraries. We will discuss what a "crate" is
    and how to find and add one via cargo. We will also look at intermediate features like structs and enums, dynamic allocation,
    traits and polymorphism, strings and manipulation, and common standard library containers and utilities.</p>
    <p>Two additional projects will also be included. Students will re-create the Wordle game in Rust and add a CLI to the "guess
    the number" game, using the 'clap' 3rd party crate. Finally, we will showcase other compelling Rust features such as lifetimes,
    async, compile-time thread safety, compile-time evaluation, hygienic macros, and interoperability with C++.</p>
    <p>By the end of the class, attendees will have acquired the knowledge and skillset necessary to start their journey with Rust,
    and they will be able to apply the learned notions to their C++ development mindset.</p>

  title: "Linux System Programming Essentials"
  description: >
    <p>This workshop provides an introduction to the low-level interfaces that are used to build system-level applications on
    Linux (and UNIX) systems. Topics covered include file I/O using system calls, signals, processes, and process lifecycle
    (<code>fork()</code>, <code>execve()</code>, <code>wait()</code>, <code>exit()</code>).</p>
    <p>There will be practical programming sessions as part of the workshop.</p>
